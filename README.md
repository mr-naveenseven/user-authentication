# 🧩 User Authentication Service (Go + Gin)

A modular backend service built with **Golang** and **Gin Framework**, providing JWT-based user authentication and user management APIs.  
The project follows a clean architecture pattern with clearly separated layers for configuration, routing, services, and data access.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **JWT-based Authentication**
- 👤 **User Management** (Create, Read, Update)
- ⚙️ **Environment-based Configuration**
- 🧱 **Layered Architecture** (Handler, Service, Repository)
- 🪵 **Structured Logging**
- 🧰 **Makefile** for build and run automation

## 🧾 API Routes

### 🔹 Auth Routes
| Method | Endpoint          | Description             |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/auth/login`      | User login and token generation |
| `POST` | `/auth/signup`     | Register a new user     |

### 🔹 User Routes
> Protected by JWT middleware (`authMiddleware`)

| Method | Endpoint            | Description               |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| `POST` | `/user`              | Create a new user         |
| `GET`  | `/user`              | Get all users             |
| `GET`  | `/user/:id`          | Get user by ID            |
| `PUT`  | `/user/:id`          | Update user by ID         |

## ⚙️ Configuration

Environment variables are defined in `configs/server_config.env`.

Example:

```env
SERVER_PORT=8080
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=user_auth
AUTH_SECRET=mysecretkey
```

🧩 Project Components
|Component          |	Description     |
|-------------------|-------------------|
|cmd/               |	Application entry points
|internal/config/   |	Configuration loader
|internal/router/   |	Route definitions & middleware
|internal/core/     |	Business logic (entities, services, repositories)
|pkg/               |	Shared utilities (JWT, password, logger)
|build/             |	Build artifacts generated by Makefile

## 🛠️ Makefile Usage

Common commands available via Makefile:

```bash
make build     # Build the binary
make run       # Run the server
make clean     # Remove build artifacts
make lint      # Run linter (if configured)
```
#### Example:
```
make run
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mr-naveenseven/user-authentication.git
cd user-authentication
```

### 2️⃣ Configure Environment

```bash
nano configs/server_config.env
```

Update the file with your own configuration.

### 3️⃣ Run the Server

```bash
make run
```

or directly:

```bash
go run cmd/auth-service.go
```

The server will start at:
👍 http://localhost:8080 ↗

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User signs up via `/auth/signup`
2. User logs in via `/auth/login`
3. Server issues a JWT token
4. Client includes the token in all requests to `/user` endpoints as:

```makefile
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
